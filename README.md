# Co-Induction

A game based on the principle of induction. The goal is to induct a rule from examples and counter-examples of coloured lines of beeds.

It is expected to be full Rust + some use of a third-party z3 library with a TUI (Terminal UI).

This game takes inspiration from the mobile game [Caterpillar Logic](https://github.com/gromozeka1980/kivy_contest_2014/tree/master/caterpillars).
